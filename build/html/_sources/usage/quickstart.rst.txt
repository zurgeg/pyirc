Quickstart
==========
To begin using PyIRC, create a client:
.. code-block:: python

from pyirc.irc import client
# Now we create the client
irc = Client("myserver.local", 1234) # Replace myserver.local with your server, and 1234 with your port


The next step is to create an `asyncio` mainloop, this is important because PyIRC is async.
.. code-block:: python

  async def mainloop(client):
    while True:
      await client.ping() # Ping the IRC server.


Now we can run it. But first, you need to import `asyncio.run` at the top of your code:
.. code-block:: python

  from asyncio import run
  # ...

Now we can actually run the mainloop:
.. code-block:: python

  # ...
  run(mainloop(irc))

Now, you may have noticed absolutely nothing happened! This is because your client has only connected to the server and started pinging. To join a channel, you can use :meth:`Client.join_channel`, like so:
.. code-block:: python

  # In your mainloop, above the while True loop:
  await client.join_channel("#example")

Of course, replacing `#example` with a channel.

For more info, you can look at :class:`Client`, or use :class:`Bot` to create a more high-level bot.
